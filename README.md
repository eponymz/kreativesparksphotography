# Kreative Sparks Photography

# TODOs

1. [] - Complete social link buttons
2. [x] - Complete email contact form
3. [] - Complete gallery component with test images (dev server only, those will not be commited to repo)
4. [] - Get rid of my ugly ass temp icon and swap it for Kreative Sparks official logo.
- Determine best course of action to link in Kreative Sparks data. (likely link to their hosted data sources as opposed to hosting data. Both for memory and data protection.)


#### If there are any questions or concerns, you can reach out to me directly through [email](mailto:isabey.dev@gmail.com).
